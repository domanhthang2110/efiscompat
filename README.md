Epic Fight x Iron's Spells Animation Fix

This mod fixes the issue where Iron's Spells casting animations don't play when using Epic Fight. It adds custom spellcasting animations through Epic Fight's system, with special variants for staves.

Features:

- Multiple casting animations, with unique staff variants.
- Configurable options for defining staff items and hiding held items during animations.
